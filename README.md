# CLI_Project

This CLI will allow you to access stats from the NHL. You will have the choice to access either team stats or individual player stats.
All data comes from CBS Sports

## Installation

Add this line to your application's Gemfile:

    $gem 'CLI_Project'

And then execute:

    $ bundle install

Or install it yourself as:

$ gem install CLI_Project

## Usage

This Gem will prompt you to know what you'd like to do.
You will have the choice to enter the number that preceeds the instruction.
    example: 
        1. Team Stats
        2. Player Stats
    If you would like to see the stats of a team, enter "1"

At any time you can type "help" to see what commands are available. You may also type in "exit" at any time to exit the gem.

## Development

After checking out the repo, run `bin/setup` to install dependencies. You can also run `bin/console` for an interactive prompt that will allow you to experiment.

To install this gem onto your local machine, run `bundle exec rake install`. To release a new version, update the version number in `version.rb`, and then run `bundle exec rake release`, which will create a git tag for the version, push git commits and tags, and push the `.gem` file to [rubygems.org](https://rubygems.org).
